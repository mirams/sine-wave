## Voltage Protocols

In [Protocols](Protocols) we include the voltage clamp waveform for each of the protocols. These files include a list 
of voltages that comprise the protocol (in mV), with each row corresponding to a 0.1 ms timestep (10kHz samples).

<a name="data"/>

## Experimental Data

The processed (leak and dofefilide subtracted) experimental data are included in [ExperimentalData](ExperimentalData). 
There is a folder corresponding to the data for each cell (the correspondence between file names and cell numbers in the paper is provided in [cell_index.txt](ExperimentalData/cell_index.txt)).
There are additional folders containing the average data for the sine wave ('average') and one containing the
repeats from the sine wave protocol for each cell ('sine_wave').
These data traces correspond to leak and dofetilide subtracted data.

Links to the full set of raw data traces in both `.abf` and plain text format can be found in [FullExperimentalData](FullExperimentalData).

### Prerequisities

You should set up the below programs before attempting to run our code.

 * For simulations and calibration: [Matlab](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) including [Mex](https://uk.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/mex.html) for using fast compiled C++ code.
 * [CVODE](http://computation.llnl.gov/projects/sundials/cvode) a C++ ODE solver that's great for stiff systems.
 * For plotting: [matplotlib v2.0.2](http://matplotlib.org/2.0.2/index.html) and [seaborn v0.7.1](http://seaborn.pydata.org/).

<a name="models"/>

### Running a simulation: model parameters and equations
The parameter values for each model are included in [ParameterSets](ParameterSets). 
Note that in each parameter set the final parameter is the conductance parameter which has been set to 0.1 for all models. 
This value is irrelevant as we scale the literature model simulations to either a simulated or experimental reference trace when plotting these model simulations or using them for comparison.

For each model (or sets of models which share the same model structure and only vary in their parameterisations) there is
a Mex file detailing the set of equations which define that model. 
For example [MexWang.c](Code/MexWang.c) is used to simulate the Wang et al. 1997 model. 
The appropriate Mex file is called when [SimulatingData.m](Code/SimulatingData.m) is run.

If any changes to Mex files are made these must be recomplied using:

`mex -I/path_to_CVODE/include -L/path_to_CVODE/lib -lsundials_nvecserial -lsundials_cvode MexFilename.c`

[modeldata.m](Code/modeldata.m) defines the model_type for each model (to determine which Mex file should be used for each model simulation) and also identifies the appropriate parameter set in [ParameterSets](ParameterSets) to be used when simulating each model.

<a name="calibration"/>

### Calibration: CMA-ES and MCMC Results
To find the best fit to the sine wave experimental data we first run [FullGlobalSearch.m](Code/FullGlobalSearch.m) for each cell and then once we've verified that the CMA-ES algorithm repeatedly returns parameters in the same region of parameter space on multiple different iterations we then run [AdaptiveMCMCStartingBestCMAES.m](Code/AdaptiveMCMCStartingBestCMAES.m) to determine MCMC chains. 

[cmaes.m](Code/cmaes.m) defines the CMA-ES algorithm used for the initial search of the parameter space before running MCMC. This file was downloaded from https://www.lri.fr/~hansen/cmaes_inmatlab.html

[FullGlobalSearch.m](Code/FullGlobalSearch.m) is run to search the parameter space and identify the best guess parameter set to be used to initialise the MCMC chain.

[AdaptiveMCMCStartingBestCMAES.m](Code/AdaptiveMCMCStartingBestCMAES.m) defines the covariance adaptive MCMC algorithm used.

The contents of [CMAESFullSearchResults](CMAESFullSearchResults) give an example output of CMAES search results to be used for running of the MCMC algorithm (for cell #5).

In [MCMCResults](MCMCResults) there are all the MCMC chains run from fitting the model to each cell's sine wave data (as well as the average model). 
We include a separate file for each cell for: (i) the parameter values in the MCMC chain; (ii) the likelihoods corresponding to these parameter values; and (iii) the acceptance rate over the running of the MCMC chain.

[PlottingSamplesFromMCMC.m](Code/PlottingSamplesFromMCMC.m) is used to assess the 95% credible intervals for the fits to the sine wave protocol when taking 1000 samples from the MCMC parameter distribution results. 
This figure is quoted in the text in Model Calibration Section 2.2.

<a name="synthetic"/>

#### Synthetic Data
In [SimulatedData](SimulatedData) we have the simulated data trace from the maximum likelihood parameters identified from fitting 
to experimental data for cell 5. 
This data trace was produced using [ProducingSimulatedDataWithNoise.m](Code/ProducingSimulatedDataWithNoise.m). 
We use these data to produce the simulated data trace MCMC distributions shown in Figure C5. 

In [MCMCResultsSimulated](MCMCResultsSimulated) there is the MCMC chain (and likelihood and acceptancerate files) for the synthetic data study results shown in Figure C5.

<a name="averaged"/>

#### Averaged/All data Model
[CreatingAveragedModel.m](Code/CreatingAveragedModel.m) creates the 'averaged' sine wave data which was used to fit an 'average' model for comparison of cell-specific vs. average model predictions.

  The data for the time constant voltage relationships for deactivation, recovery from inactivation and instantaneous inactivation were fitted manually and so their data can be found in the respective folders in [Figures/figure_5](Figures/figure_5). Run [plot_figure_5_results.py](Figures/figure_5/plot_figure_5_results.py) to produce figure 5.
- Figure 6 - run [PlottingFigure6APFigure.m](Code/PlottingFigure6APFigure.m) to generate data for Figure 6 and plot results using [plot_figure_6_results.py](Figures/figure_6/plot_figure_6_results.py)

## Additional Notes

Any remaining `.m` files not described in this document are used within the individual scripts described above with a note within each script about their use.

Note that the Zeng model contained singularities and was unable to simulate our action potential protocol (Pr6) in its
original form, so whenever the action potential waveform is simulated we use a version of the Zeng et al. model where
the singularities have been removed (as in MexZengTol.c).

We also note that the leak subtracted dofetilide subtracted experimental traces for the activation kinetics protocols for cells 3, 4 and 7 (16708016, 16708060 and 16704007) appear to be over leak subtracted when we use the same leak resistance values identified for appropriately leak subtracting the sine wave trace for these cells. 
The activation kinetics protocols are performed at the very start of the protocol sequence so we may expect some change in leak resitance by the time the sine wave protocol is performed. 
As we do not use the activation kinetics data for these cells and the remaining protocols appear to be appropriately leak subtracted using the leak resistance values identified for each cell from the sine wave protocol, we do not adjust the leak resistance for activation kinetics data.

A final point to note is that when comparing our input voltage protocol with the command voltage recorded in the results file
output from the pClamp10 software, we observed a time shift of one sample period (0.1 ms) in the applied protocol to that
recorded in experiment. This shift was consistent in all recordings, and is likely due to a timing offset in the digitizer. 
To account for this observation, to ensure the use of recorded currents and correct corresponding applied voltage, we 
applied a time shift of 0.1 ms to the input protocol when performing simulations for comparison with experimental data.
